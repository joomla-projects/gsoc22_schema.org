# Joomla Release Checklist
The following document is intended to be a checklist for each release for use by the release lead. It should not include detailed explanations. These belong in the Release Procedure Documentation here: https://docs.joomla.org/Joomla:Release_procedure_and_checklist.

At all stages here it is assumed you have a copy of the joomla-cms repo downloaded. Your release branch is clean and in the code snippets below that you have two remotes - an `upstream` remote that points to this repo and a `security` remote which points to the security private repository. You should also ensure all your commits and tags are signed by a GPG key that GitHub recognises.

## Checklist (Beta 1 - Preparation)

- [ ] Update Composer dependencies to their latest version
- [ ] Update NPM dependencies to their latest version
- [ ] If a new major/minor release - update the Wiki PHP configuration file to create alias for the new help screen alias')

## Checklist (Release Candidate - Preparation)

- [ ] Agree Stable Announcement URL with the marketing team
- [ ] Create Release Candidate PR for joomla/update.joomla.org
- [ ] Check with Joomla Security Strike Team for any security patches
- [ ] Ensure Release FAQ Pages have been created on Documentation Site

## Checklist (Release Candidate - Release)

- [ ] Inform CMS Release Team in Glip highlighting anything that needs specific testing
- [ ] Inform CMS Maintenance Team in Glip that branches are locked for release. You should be the only person merging code changes at this point.
- [ ] Run build/bump.php to fix the since tags then push so other branches don't have conflicts when merging in changes.
```
git checkout 3.10-dev
git fetch upstream
git pull
# Note the version here should be the same as the existing version
php build/bump.php -v 3.10.X-dev
git commit -am 'fix since tags'
git push upstream 3.10-dev
```
- [ ] Build the release
```
git checkout <branch>
git fetch upstream
git pull
php build/deleted_file_check.php --from=3.10.X
cat build/deleted_files.txt -> script.php
php build/bump.php -v 3.10.X-rc1
git commit -am 'Joomla! 3.10.X Release Candidate 1'
git tag -s 3.10.X-rc1 -m 'Joomla! 3.10.X Release Candidate 1'
php build/build.php
cd build/tmp/packages
cat build/tmp/checksums.txt
php build/bump.php -v 3.10.X-rc2-dev
git commit -am 'reset to dev'
git push upstream --tags
```
- [ ] Create the RC release on GitHub
- [ ] Upload the packages to the GitHub release
- [ ] Publish GitHub release (remember to mark it as a pre-release!)
- [ ] `git push upstream 3.10-dev`
- [ ] Trigger new nightly build: [https://ci.joomla.org/joomla/joomla-cms](https://ci.joomla.org/joomla/joomla-cms) -> New Build -> "<branch-dev>"
- [ ] Wait for `.org Build Notifications` to report back
- [ ] Merge the [joomla/update.joomla.org PR](https://github.com/joomla/update.joomla.org/pulls)
- [ ] Wait for `.org Build Notifications` to report back

- [ ] Inform Translation Teams via eMail and Forum Thread (via co-ordinator)

### Extra Steps when there are security issues

```
git checkout 3.10-dev
git fetch upstream
git pull
# If multiple patches repeat the next two lines until all PRs are applied
git fetch security pull/<PRNUM>/head:<new_branch>
git merge --squash <new_branch>
git commit -am 'Prepare Joomla! 3.10.X'
php build/deleted_file_check.php --from=3.10.X
cat build/deleted_files.txt -> script.php
php build/bump.php -v 3.10.X-rc1-sec
git commit -am 'Joomla! 3.10.X Release Candidate 1 with security patches'

cd build/tmp/packages
cat build/tmp/checksums.txt
```
